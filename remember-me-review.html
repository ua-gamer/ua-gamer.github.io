                Cool sci-fi 3rd-person fighting game with lively music and good graphics for its time.
                Overall pretty fun and enjoyable but it fails in several areas making it a good candidate to buy on sale.

                When I was buying this game on sale few years ago I was judging it buy the screenshots and trailers.
                Both looked very nice to my eye that I decided to pull the trigger. But at the years went by I couldn't
                find the time to play it. At this point the game is about 6 years old. How is it then in this day and
                age? Let's find out...
                <br>
                <br>

                <img class="in-article-image" src="/images/remember-me/1.jpg" />

                <br>
                <br>
                When I started the first mission I immediately noticed that this game is pretty old (but I played even
                older games, BloodRayne comes to mind) but it's not terrible by any means. Most notably the visual style
                is great. It's pretty fresh, it's consistent and it looks nice. The music is great for my taste. I'm a
                huge fan of electronic music and even more so when music fits the narrative and the world in general. It
                helps to build an atmosphere during fights and after completing certain parts of the game. Sound design
                is decent to but I noticed that sound would just disappear until the end of a fight or would just start
                to judder for no reason. And I mean no reason. Sometimes it would happen when there is one or two
                enemies but would be just fine when there is a hoard of enemies.

                <br>
                <br>
                In terms of gameplay the best part starts when you start fighting. Combo system is nice and the
                animations are pretty fluid. But it fails to follow its own rules when it comes to combos. It says that
                I should time the next hit when current strike hits but it doesn't seem to be the case as the combos
                would often cancel for no discernable reason. Or the game just decided to start a combo from your last
                hit and not the one that you actually intended. So I ended up just button-mashing in some cases which
                proved to be the more reliable way to get the combos. And now that I think of it there aren't too many
                combos which is probably fine considering that that they don't always register correctly. But when you
                do the combos it feel pretty cool.

                I did enjoy the fights but sometimes it would cause me to rage in the few final episodes where the game
                would just throw a few enemies that you cannot hit until you do the right thing but to do the right
                thing you need to hit enemies which you can barely because you're in a tiny room with a whack ton of
                enemies and you cannot do combos properly. But thankfully it only happened twice.
                And while we're talking about fights let's talk bosses. There are couple of interesting and fun bosses
                but there are also couple of less fun bosses.

                <br>

                Another area where they could have improved is exploration and movement freedom. I would sometime miss a
                collectible because when I got to a place from which I could see it I would already pass the point of no
                return and the checkpoint was already saved. And I was not able to find a simple way to restart a level
                without going to menu and starting a specific level. I didn't want to do this because it would just
                break the flow of the story and it actually discouraged me from doing it even after I beat the game
                because I didn't want to start over if I accidentally go into a room and the door would close and I
                wouldn't be able to get out without restarting. And overall the game felt restricted. I wasn’t able to
                go anywhere I was not supposed to. Just let me go there even if there's a dead end. But if you just
                follow the pass and don't mind missing pick-ups that help you upgrade and make the game a bit easier
                that it's fine I guess.

                <br>
                <br>

                <img class="in-article-image" src="/images/remember-me/4.jpg" />

                <br>
                <br>

                The story is good though. It's about memories, how they can be taken, shared or withdrawn from a person
                and ultimately what consequences with that have on the society. I really liked it and was really
                involved and interested in what happens next. There were moments where I though why would I do that and
                felt sorry for being forced to do things I wouldn't do if given the choice. The ending was good even
                though it didn't end the way I would like. And there were a few inconsistencies between what the
                protagonist said and did but nothing major.

                <br>

                As you can tell I enjoyed it and you will too if you are willing to look past some of its issues and if
                you like games like Tomb Raider but wouldn't mind the world to be a bit smaller and in a different era
                and with fists instead of bow and arrow.
